Module 5: HTML Images

5.1 Embedding Images (<img>)
The <img> tag is used to embed images in an HTML document. Unlike other HTML elements, the <img> tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag.
Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of Image">

5.2 Image Attributes: src, alt, width, height
src: This attribute specifies the path to the image file. It can be a relative path (local file) or an absolute path (URL).
Example:
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery">
alt: This attribute provides alternative text for the image. This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded and is also useful for screen readers, improving accessibility.
Example:
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery">
width and height: These attributes specify the width and height of the image in pixels. Itâ€™s a good practice to include these attributes to reserve space for the image while it loads.
Example:
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery" width="300" height="200">

5.3 Image Formats and Optimization
Image Formats: Common image formats used in web development include:
JPEG: Good for photographs; supports millions of colors but does not support transparency.
PNG: Supports transparency and is suitable for graphics with fewer colors.
GIF: Supports animations and is limited to 256 colors.
SVG: Scalable vector graphics, ideal for logos and icons since they can be resized without loss of quality.
Optimization: Optimize images for the web to improve loading times and performance. Techniques include:
Compressing images to reduce file size without significantly affecting quality.
Using responsive images with the <picture> element or the srcset attribute to provide different images for different screen sizes.

5.4 Adding Favicon to Web Pages
A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon displayed in the browser tab next to the page title. It helps users identify and locate your site among multiple tabs.
To add a favicon, use the <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document, pointing to the favicon file (usually a .ico, .png, or .svg file).
Example:
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
Common Image Formats

1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
Description: JPEG is a commonly used format for photographic images. It supports millions of colors but does not support transparency. It uses lossy compression, which means some image quality is sacrificed for a smaller file size.
Use Case: Best for photographs or images with gradients.
Example: photo.jpg
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape in JPEG format">

2. PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
Description: PNG is a lossless image format that supports transparency. It is ideal for images with sharp edges and flat colors, such as logos and graphics.
Use Case: Best for images requiring transparency or with text/graphics.
Example: logo.png
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Company Logo in PNG format">

3. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
Description: GIF is a bitmap image format that supports animations and has a limited color palette (256 colors). It is a lossless format, but due to its color limitations, it is not suitable for photographs.
Use Case: Best for simple graphics and animations.
Example: animation.gif
<img src="images/animation.gif" alt="Animated graphic in GIF format">

4. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
Description: SVG is an XML-based vector image format that is resolution-independent and can be scaled without losing quality. It is ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations.
Use Case: Best for logos and icons that need to be resized without loss of quality.
Example: icon.svg
<img src="images/icon.svg" alt="Scalable vector graphic in SVG format">
