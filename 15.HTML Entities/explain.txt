Module 15: HTML Entities
HTML entities are used to display reserved characters (characters that have a special meaning in HTML) or characters that cannot be typed directly. These entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). For example, the < character is reserved in HTML because it is used to define tags, so we use the entity &lt; to display it.

Common HTML Entities:
Here are some frequently used HTML entities:

Entity Code	Description	Display
&nbsp;	Non-breaking space	 
&copy;	Copyright symbol	©
&lt;	Less than symbol	<
&gt;	Greater than symbol	>
&amp;	Ampersand	&
&quot;	Double quotation	"

Example Code Using HTML Entities:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Entities Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    
    <!-- Displaying reserved characters using HTML entities -->
    <p>
        In HTML, the less than sign &lt; and the greater than sign &gt; are used for tags.<br>
        To display an ampersand (&amp;), we use the entity <code>&amp;amp;</code>.
    </p>

    <!-- Using special characters -->
    <p>
        This sentence contains a copyright symbol: &copy; 2024.<br>
        We can also use a non-breaking space between words like: Hello&nbsp;World!
    </p>

    <!-- Double quotes using entities -->
    <p>
        Double quotes can be represented as: &quot;Hello World&quot;.
    </p>

</body>
</html>

Explanation:
Reserved Characters: In HTML, symbols like <, >, and & have special meanings. Using entities like &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; allows you to display them as plain text.
Special Characters: The copyright symbol &copy; and non-breaking space &nbsp; are used to represent common symbols and prevent line breaks between specific words.
Quotation Marks: &quot; is used to display double quotes.
Using HTML entities is essential for writing clean HTML that displays special characters correctly.
