Module 2: Text Formatting and Structure

2.1 Headings (<h1> to <h6>)
HTML Headings are used to create headings or titles for sections of content.
Headings range from <h1> (the most important/large heading) to <h6> (the least important/smallest heading).
Example:
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a Heading 6</h6>
<h1> is typically used for the main title of the webpage.
<h2> to <h6> are used for subheadings and organizing sections within the content.

2.2 Paragraphs (<p>)
Paragraphs are used to group blocks of text. The <p> element creates a new paragraph.
Example:
<p>This is a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are used to structure content into readable blocks.</p>
<p>Another paragraph of text for better readability and organization.</p>
Paragraphs automatically add space before and after themselves.

2.3 Line Breaks (<br>)
The <br> tag creates a line break, which forces the text to continue on the next line. It does not create a new paragraph but simply breaks the line.
Example:
<p>This is a sentence with a<br>line break in the middle of it.</p>
<br> is an empty tag, meaning it does not have a closing tag.

2.4 Horizontal Lines (<hr>)
The <hr> tag is used to create a horizontal line (or rule) across the page, typically used to separate content sections visually.
Example:
<p>Content before the horizontal rule.</p>
<hr>
<p>Content after the horizontal rule.</p>
Like <br>, <hr> is also an empty tag and does not require a closing tag.

2.5 Text Formatting Tags
HTML provides several tags to format the text in various ways:
Bold (<b>)
The <b> tag makes text bold, which is typically used to emphasize words.
Example:
<p>This is <b>bold text</b>.</p>
Italic (<i>)
The <i> tag italicizes the text, making it slanted.
Example:
<p>This is <i>italicized text</i>.</p>
Strong (<strong>)
The <strong> tag is used to define important or emphasized text, typically displayed in bold, but semantically indicates importance.
Example:
<p>This is <strong>important text</strong>.</p>
Emphasis (<em>)
The <em> tag emphasizes text by typically rendering it in italics, similar to <i>, but semantically represents emphasis.
Example:
<p>This is <em>emphasized text</em>.</p>
Underline (<u>)
The <u> tag underlines text, adding a horizontal line below it. Use this sparingly as underlines are often reserved for hyperlinks.
Example:
<p>This is <u>underlined text</u>.</p>
Superscript (<sup>)
The <sup> tag raises text slightly above the baseline, typically used for exponents or footnote numbers.
Example:
<p>This is 10<sup>2</sup>, which equals 100.</p>
Subscript (<sub>)
The <sub> tag lowers text slightly below the baseline, often used in chemical formulas or mathematical expressions.
Example:
<p>The chemical formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

Key Takeaways from Module 2:
Headings help structure your content hierarchically.
Paragraphs and line breaks are used to create organized and readable text.
Horizontal lines (<hr>) visually separate content.
Text formatting tags like bold, italic, underline, superscript, and subscript allow you to emphasize and structure content in a readable way.
