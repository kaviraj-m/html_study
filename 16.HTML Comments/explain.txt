Module 16: HTML Comments
In HTML, comments are used to insert notes, explanations, or other non-executable text into the HTML document. These comments do not appear on the web page when viewed in a browser. They are helpful for developers to document their code and leave helpful notes for themselves or others.

Syntax:

<!-- This is a comment -->
Anything placed between <!-- and --> will be treated as a comment and ignored by the browser.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>HTML Comments</h1>

    <!-- This is a comment explaining the heading below -->
    <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>

    <!-- This is another comment explaining the paragraph below -->
    <p>This paragraph contains information about the website.</p>

    <!--
        Multiline comments can be useful for providing detailed explanations.
        This is a placeholder section for future content.
    -->
    <p>Coming Soon...</p>

    <!-- 
        Important note: Remember to remove any unnecessary comments before deployment
        to avoid clutter in the code.
    -->
    
</body>
</html>
Best Practices for Using Comments:
Keep Comments Relevant and Clear: Comments should describe what the code does or why it's there, not obvious things. For example, avoid comments like <!-- This is a paragraph --> since the <p> tag already makes that clear.

Use Comments to Explain Complex Logic: If a section of code is particularly complicated or important, use comments to explain its purpose.

Avoid Overusing Comments: Too many comments can clutter the code. Only use them where necessary to explain or clarify parts of the code.

Update Comments Along with Code Changes: Outdated comments can be misleading. Ensure comments stay in sync with code updates.

Remove Comments in Production: In a production environment, unnecessary comments should be removed to reduce file size and improve page load performance.
