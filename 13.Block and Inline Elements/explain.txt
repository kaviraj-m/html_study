Module 13: HTML Block and Inline Elements
In this module, we will explore the difference between block-level and inline-level elements in HTML. Understanding this distinction helps in structuring web pages and controlling the layout of your content.

13.1 Difference Between Block-Level and Inline-Level Elements
Block-Level Elements:
Block-level elements are displayed as blocks, meaning they take up the full width of their container (parent element) by default.
These elements always start on a new line and can contain other block-level or inline elements.
Block-level elements affect the layout significantly because they cause a "block" of space to be taken up.

Inline-Level Elements:
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
These elements do not affect the surrounding elements' layout as significantly as block-level elements.
Inline elements typically sit inside block elements and can be nested within other inline elements, but they cannot contain block elements.

13.2 Examples of Block-Level Elements
Block elements are commonly used to define large sections or containers in a webpage. Below are some examples:

1. <div> (Division)
The <div> element is a generic container used for grouping other elements. It is a block-level element.

<div>
    This is a block-level element that takes up the full width.
</div>

2. <section> (Section)
The <section> element defines a section of the document, such as a group of related content.

<section>
    <h2>Section Heading</h2>
    <p>This is a section block-level element.</p>
</section>

3. <header> (Header)
The <header> element represents the introductory content or a set of navigation links.

<header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
    <nav>
        <a href="#home">Home</a>
        <a href="#about">About</a>
    </nav>
</header>
Other Block-Level Elements:
<article>: Represents an independent piece of content.
<footer>: Defines a footer for a document or section.
<aside>: Defines content related to the main content, like sidebars.
13.3 Examples of Inline Elements
Inline elements are commonly used for styling small portions of text or inserting images, links, and other small content into the flow of text. Below are some examples:
1. <span> (Span)
The <span> element is used to group inline elements for styling purposes.

<p>This is a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> word within a paragraph.</p>
The <span> tag allows you to apply styles or manipulate small parts of text without disrupting the paragraph's flow.

2. <a> (Anchor)
The <a> element creates a hyperlink, which is inline by default.

<p>Visit <a href="https://www.example.com">Example Website</a> for more information.</p>
The link does not break the flow of the text and is displayed inline.

3. <img> (Image)
The <img> element inserts an image and is also inline by default.

<p>This is an image: <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image"></p>
The image is displayed inline with the text, without causing the text to break onto a new line.
Other Inline Elements:
<em>: Italicizes text for emphasis.
<strong>: Boldens text for strong emphasis.
<abbr>: Represents abbreviations.
